# This is Spotify
### Playing with and performing EDA on the top 50 songs on Spotify globally (2023-2025)

For this project, I wanted to explore what kind of music tops the charts globally, and explore how tastes differ in each country. 

A preface on the dataset: it includes data from countries like India and Indonesia, which have very [small user bases](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/spotify-users-by-country). The sample is likely to not be a full representation of the full country. Also, people in other countries have been known to use VPNs to [buy plans from India, for example](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/how-to-get-cheap-spotify/), so the data may be slightly biased. However, it's still a fun project, and I had fun playing with it and exploring!

(P.S, the other titles I was thinking of were "Spotify, Wrapped" and "Top of the Plots")
